# Agile development tutorial

A tutorial for *agile development* of cloud applications.

## Introduction

This tutorial illustrates typical workflows and tools in agile development, addressing key concepts,
learning key technologies and going through the full cycle of SCRUM development.
By the end of this tutorial everyone should be able to develop cloud applications collaboratively
using

* GitHub
* ZenHub
* IBM Cloud
* Travis CI
* Pull Requests
* Test coverage
* SCRUM methodology
* Visual Studio Code
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Deployment
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Foundry applications

## Prerequisites

* Internet access
* A computer running either MacOS, Windows or Linux
