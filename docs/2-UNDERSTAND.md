# Understand agile development practices and frameworks

## Having SCRUM meetings

1. The SCRUM methodology is charaterized by having specific [roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Roles) and [workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Workflow).
1. The SCRUM [roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Roles) can be summarized as
    * Product Owner: represents the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer.
    * Scrum master: a facilitator that helps to ensure the team follows the agreed processes.
    * Development team: responsible for delivering potentially shippable product increments.
1. The SCRUM [workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Workflow) can be summarized as
    * Sprint planning: bi-weekly meetings for agreeing on the tasks to be done during that sprint.
    * Daily scrum: 15-min meeting to report on what was done the previous day, the plans for that day and potential impediments.
    * Sprint review: after the sprint, the team reviews what was done and what can be improved in the next sprints.
1. Everything that happens during the SCRUM cycle should be captured in a [issue board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) which should be **always up-to-date**.

## Using the "GitHub Flow" branching model

1. Read the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching model documentation.
1. Locate the issue that has been assigned to you in the [ZenHub board](https://zenhub.ibm.com/app/workspaces/agile-tutorial-5c240173b7d41fe10dbe52e6/boards).
1. Create a new [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch) from `master`, making sure the branch name resembles the associated issue.
1. Add new code to your branch by making [commits](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit) and writing meaningful commit messages.
1. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request) from your branch into branch `master` and explain the proposed changes.
1. Discuss you submission in the Pull Request review process, ensuring all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#status-checks) are successful.
1. Once the Pull Request has been approved, [merge](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#merge) your branch into `master`.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Open the [`brl-its/agile-tutorial`](https://github.ibm.com/brl-its/agile-tutorial) repository on GitHub.
1. Select your branch from the drop-down menu on the left.
